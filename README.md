# Class Viewer

 - Class Viewer is a program that visualizes student performances. This program was created for two reasons: to make grading student assignments easier and to foster insights into critical components about the class.

How it works:

- This project is currently being rebuilt as a React and Node.js application (was originally a Python-Flask project). There are currently no previews or demos of the newer version at the moment.
